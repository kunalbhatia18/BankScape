I was not able to send an email with the user's info as I made a static website and realised later that I should've made it in react but there was no time left. <br>
Instead now I have extracted the user's IP Address and User agent but it exists in the console. You can open the console and look. Your IP Address and User agent from which you opened will  be there.
<br>
You can type console.log('useragent'); for USER AGENT<br>
You can type console.log('ip'); for IP ADDRESS<br>
in CONSOLE
